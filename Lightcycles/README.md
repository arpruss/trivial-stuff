# Command-line Lightcycles

A quick project made by recycling a large percentage of code from 
[command-line snake](https://github.com/wildp/command-line-stuff/tree/master/Snake)
as well as reusing the collision detection algorithm from
[lightcycles++](https://github.com/wildp/lightcycles-collection/tree/master/lightcyclesplusplus/source).
