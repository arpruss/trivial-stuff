# Command-line Lightcycles

~~A quick project made by recycling a large percentage of code from~~
~~[command-line snake](https://github.com/wildp/command-line-stuff/tree/master/Snake)~~
~~as well as reusing the collision detection algorithm from~~
~~[lightcycles++](https://github.com/wildp/lightcycles-collection/tree/master/lightcyclesplusplus/source).~~
